# Study of a simple dataset

## Context of the study
It was a little assignment as a part of a DCU class to get to know data analytics tools and the way to implement them.

## Description of the dataset
The dataset contains 5 columns : 
* Sepal.Length
* Sepal.Width
* Petal.Length
* Petal.Width
* Species

## Goal
We want to be able to tell what species a flower belong to according to these 4 previous parameters

## General Appproach
As it is my first opportunity to use such tools, I tried to keep it simple.
I began by looking at the data and filling the missing values.
Then I chose to go for a decision tree that simply describes what the box plots enabled us to understand.
Finally I tried other algorithms (Naive Bayes Classifier, SVM) to compare their results.

## Conclusion
Despite a simple approach the results are good enough (nearly 90%).
